# Automated-Railway-Gate-Control-system

# Objective :-



The objective of this project is to create an automatic railway gate control system which can be  implemented easily in roads. Generally there are manual gate control system which are  maintained by person.As vehicles are increasing day by day it has become more difficult to  control the gate manually.As a result often accident occurs and many people become injured  badly and sometimes it become very serious when people died due to this type of accidents.
This project can help us to reduce accidents in our country by introducing automatic railway  gate control system
